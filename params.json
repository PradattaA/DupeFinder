{"name":"Dupefinder","tagline":"This a Duplicate File Finder Application.","body":"# Welcome to Dupefinder's GitHub Pages.\r\n\r\nThis a Duplicate File Finder Application. This application searches all drives and directories from the system for duplicate files. User need to select a file and then search. After a complete scan this application will find all duplicated copies of the given file. User can scan entire system of specify limited drives for the scanning process.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n- Windows or Linux\r\n- Maven (for building)\r\n\r\n## Building DupeFinder\r\nDupeFinder is a standard Maven project. Simply run the following command from the project root directory:\r\n\r\n    mvn clean install\r\nOn the first build, Maven will download all the dependencies from the internet and cache them in the local repository (~/.m2/repository), which can take a considerable amount of time. Subsequent builds will be faster.\r\n\r\n## Running DupeFinder in your IDE\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nAfter building DupeFinder for the first time, you can load the project into your IDE and run the application. I recommend using [**IntelliJ IDEA**](www.jetbrains.com/idea/), because the GUI is designed using INteliJ GUI BUilder Plugin, which may not work in anyother IDE. As DupeFinder is a standard Maven project, you can import it into your IDE using the root pom.xml file. In **IntelliJ**, choose Open Project from the Quick Start box or choose Open from the File menu and select the root **pom.xml** file.\r\n\r\nAfter opening the project in IntelliJ, double check that the Java SDK is properly configured properly for the project:\r\n\r\nOpen the File menu and select Project Structure\r\nIn the SDKs section, ensure that a 1.7 JDK is selected (create one if none exist)\r\nIn the Project section, ensure the Project language level is set to 7.0 as DupeFinder makes use of several Java 7 language features\r\nDupeFinder comes with sample configuration that should work out-of-the-box for development. Use the following options to create a run configuration:\r\n\r\n- **Main Class:** \t\t\t`com.neelhridoy.dupfinder.gui.DupeFinderGui`\r\n- **Working directory:** \t`$MODULE_DIR$`\r\n- **Resource directory:** \t`$MODULE_DIR$/resources/`\r\n- **Source directory:** \t`$MODULE_DIR$/src/`\r\n\r\nThe working directory should be the DupeFinder subdirectory. In **IntelliJ**, using $MODULE_DIR$ accomplishes this automatically. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
